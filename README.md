Machine Learning versus Statistical Models for Time Series Forecasting
This project provides a comparison of machine learning and statistical models for time series forecasting. The goal is to assist helping people make a choice between using one or the other, by giving insights based on a use case. There is a blog with just text and plots and a version with all the Python code. If you have any questions or insights you can reach me @NoahJSchutte.
